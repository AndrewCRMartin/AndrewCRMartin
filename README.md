Hi! I'm Andrew. I'm a Professor of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at University College London. My group develops software to analyze protein sequence and structure - in particular, we have an interest in antibodies (and their use as therapeutics) and in the effects of mutations on protein sequence and structure.

In this repository, you will find a number of personal projects - either work things that only I work on, or some more off-topic things.

You can also visit our group account at @ACRMGroup and our web pages at http://www.bioinf.org.uk/
